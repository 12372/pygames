# pygames

Games using pygame. These are a few example "games" to get me started with the pygame framework. It's easy enough to build your own, I recommend trying it. You can start with mine! 

<h4> Install </h4>
You'll need pygame installed before going. Try these links: 
<ul><li>http://www.pygame.org/wiki/CompileUbuntu</li>
<li>http://pygame.org/wiki/macintosh</li></ul>

Several "games are included" and each runs from a single .py file with corresponding "images/" folder for sprites. 

<h4>Sines</h4>
Just a goofy sprite creator. Here's a video: <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wopx-dekZKk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h4>Mooker</h4>
Free form pellet collection, dodge the bullets! You can't win. 

<h4>DocDuk</h4>
Simple Gravity Engine and Jumping with, so far as I can tell, no purpose. 


<h4>Resources</h4>
